Data and scripts for phylogenomic analysis of Synergus itoensis and relatives

Uppload of data in progress. Available so far:
Fasta files of all gene sequences of single copy orthologs (for each group, one fasta file containing 4 unaligned sequences)
Fasta files of all protein sequences of single copy orthologs (for each group, one fasta file containing 4 unaligned sequences. Additionally, 4 fasta files with all the single copy orthologs from each of the species)
Fasta files of all protein alignents of single copy orthologs generated using Muscle (for each group, one fasta file containing 4 aligned sequences). Additionally, one file listing the lowest identity and lowest similarity to the consensus sequence among the four aligned sequences.
Fasta files of all protein alignents of single copy orthologs generated using ClustalOmega (for each group, one fasta file containing 4 aligned sequences) Additionally, one file listing the lowest identity and lowest similarity to the consensus sequence among the four aligned sequences.
